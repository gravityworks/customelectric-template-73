            <p className="text-white mb-6 mx-auto max-w-2xl">
              In the spring of 98, a young journeyman electrician named Dean took a leap of faith. With just a handful of tools and a small pickup truck, he launched what would become Custom Electric Inc.
              <br /><br />
              From those humble beginnings, Custom Electric has grown into a trusted name in the Greater Lansing and Mid-Michigan areas. Over the years, we've served thousands of customersâ€”handling everything from commercial wiring projects to simple home outlet installations.
